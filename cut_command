this will print the firt field 

cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ':' -f1  using delemeter : this will cut the output of the passwd just extend the field


For example, to display the 1st and 3rd fields using “:” as a delimiter, you would type:

cut test.txt -d ':' -f 1,3

You can use any single character as a delimiter. In the following example, we are using the space character as a delimiter and printing the 2nd field:

echo "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" | cut -d ' ' -f 2

output - ipsum


Select the 5th byte:

echo 'drüberspringen' | cut -b 5
output-  b

Select the 5th, 9th, and 13th bytes:

echo 'drüberspringen' | cut -b 5,9,13

output-  bpg

cuting the -b byte one to six and the cut again of field one with delm :
└──╼ #cat /etc/passwd | cut -b 1-6 | cut -d ':' -f1
 
output - root
daemon
bin
sys
sync
games


Select the range from 1st to 5th byte:

echo 'drüberspringen' | cut -b 1-5

output-   drüb 

get list of all users of passwd

└──╼ #cat /etc/passwd |  cut -d ':' -f1

└──╼ #ifconfig | grep inet | cut -d ":" -f2 | cut -b14-27 | cut -d ' ' -f1

output
